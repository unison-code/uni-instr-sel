===========================
= HOW TO BUILD AND INSTALL
===========================

We denote the folder wherein this README file is located as <REPO>.

First, a customized version LLVM 3.8 needs to be installed on the machine. Just
follow these instructions.

1. Clone the LLVM repo and checkout the correct branch.

   git clone ssh://git@github.com:unison-code/llvm.git uni-is-llvm
   cd uni-is-llvm
   git checkout release_38-uni-is

2. Clone LLVM clang (assuming that your terminal is currently standing in the
   'uni-is-llvm' folder).

   git clone http://llvm.org/git/clang.git --branch release_38 --single-branch \
       tools/clang

3. Configure and build LLVM (assuming that your terminal is currently standing
   in the 'uni-is-llvm' folder).

   cd ..
   mkdir uni-is-llvm-build
   cd uni-is-llvm-build
   cmake -LLVM_BUILD_LLVM_DYLIB ../uni-is-llvm
   make -j <num cores>

If this repo has recently been cloned, then we must initiate the submodule that
contains the 'llvm-general' Haskell packages.

5. Initiate and update submodules (assuming that your terminal is currently
   standing in the <REPO> folder).

   git submodule init
   git submodule update

Before we can build the 'llvm-general' package, we must ensure that the LLVM
binaries are available in the default search locations. This is done by
extending the $PATH variable. The toolchain also requires that the environment
variable UNI_IS_LLVM_BUILD_DIR has been set. Assume the full path to the LLVM
build directory is denoted as <LLVM_BUILD> (in this example, it's the folder
with basename 'uni-is-llvm-build'). Then:

6. In your ~/.bashrc file, add the following lines:

   export UNI_IS_LLVM_BUILD_DIR=<LLVM_BUILD>
   export PATH=$UNI_IS_LLVM_BUILD_DIR/bin:$PATH

7. To ensure the new $PATH is loaded, either open a new terminal or run
   following command:

   source ~/.bashrc

Now we can build the tool chain.

8. Build tool chain (assuming that your terminal is currently standing in the
   <REPO> folder).

   make
